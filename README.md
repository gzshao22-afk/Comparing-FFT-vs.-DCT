# Comparing-FFT-vs.-DCT
Fourier transform vs. discrete cosine transform

For data compression, Principle Component Decomposition (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is often used. 

In induatrial grade image and audio compression (jpeg and mp3), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is a more efficient way. DCT is similar to FFT or DFT in that it identified the key frequencies. DCT differs from FFT/DFT in that it requires data to be symmetrical around origin.
